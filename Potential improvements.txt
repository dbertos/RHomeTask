Potential improvements:
    1. Make locking on specific Account records (table rows) on a database level while making money transfer. Something similar to:
        {
            Account firstLock = getFirstAccountToLockOn(sender, receiver);
            Account secondLock = getSecondAccountToLockOn(sender, receiver);

            synchronized (firstLock) {
                synchronized (secondLock) {
                    if (sender.hasSufficientBalance(amount)) {
                        makeMoneySwap(sender, receiver, amount);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        Not sure how to achieve this with Hibernate and hsqldb

    2. Use in-memory db rather than file one for test environment
    3. Make MoneyService/makeTransfer accept entity or form rather than url parameters to be valid POST request
